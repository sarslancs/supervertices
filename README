SUPERVERTEX CLUSTERING

Developed in MATLAB R2014a on Ubuntu 14.04

Prerequisites:
iso2mesh: a Matlab-based mesh generator @ http://iso2mesh.sourceforge.net/
MATLAB GIfTI library @ http://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/gifti/
Connectome Workbench @ http://www.humanconnectome.org/software/get-connectome-workbench.html

Dataset:
This version has been tested on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) datasets. The
code has a deep dependency with the HCP data structures. The data can be 
downloaded from https://db.humanconnectome.org. Make sure that you extract 
all the files into the same folder or you may need to modify the code 
according to your own directory structure.

Tutorial:
Simply run RUN_supervertex_clustering after setting the Path and updating 
directories the datasets are read from.
